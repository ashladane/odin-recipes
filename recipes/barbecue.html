    <h2>Filipino Style Pork BBQ</h2>
    <p>Pork barbecue in bamboo skewers is what <strong>Filipino 
        Style Pork BBQ</strong> is all about. It is composed of thinly 
        sliced pork pieces <br> that are marinated in a special 
        mixture of seasonings and spices. In the Philippines, 
        it is normally grilled over wood charcoal <br> and dipped 
        in a tall jar of spicy vinegar before eating.</p>
   <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lbs. pork shoulder <em>sliced into thin pieces</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Marinade Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup juice extracted from calamansi or lemon</li>
        <li>¾ cup banana ketchup</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups lemon or lime soda</li>
    </ul> <br>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the pork slices in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add all the marinade ingredients. Mix well. 
            Cover the bowl and marinate for at least 3 hours. 
            Note: I strongly suggest<br> marinating overnight for 
            best results.</li>
        <li>Fasten the marinated pork together using bamboo skewers.</li>
        <li>Heat-up the grill. Start to grill your Filipino Style pork BBQ 
            for 3 to 5 minutes per side until the meat is thoroughly cooked. 
            <br> Make sure to always baste the BBQ when flipping it over. Note: 
            the basting sauce ingredients are the same as the marinade <br> ingredients 
            minus the lemon soda.</li>
        <li>Serve with spicy vinegar.</li>
        <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

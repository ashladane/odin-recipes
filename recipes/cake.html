        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</em></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons espresso powder (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or canola oil or melted coconut oil)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) freshly brewed strong hot coffee (regular or decaf)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Chocolate Buttercream</h4>
    <ul><li>1 and 1/4 cups (282g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>3 and 1/2 cups (420g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or dutch process)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or dutch process)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>optional for decoration: semi-sweet chocolate chips</li></ul>
       

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with
            parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment <br>
            paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s
            helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)</li>
        <li><Strong>Make the cake:</Strong>Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking
            powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl.<br>
            Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment
            (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on <br>
            medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until
            combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add
            the hot <br> water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the
            batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.</li>
        <li>Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a 
            toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so <br>
            keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in 
            the center comes out clean. <em>(<strong>Note:</strong> Even if they’re completely done, the <br>
                cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center. Cocoa powder is simply
                not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can’t hold up to all<br>
                the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It’s normal!)</em></li>
        <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely
            in the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the buttercream:</strong> With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment,
            beat the butter on medium speed until creamy—about<br> 2 minutes. Add confectioners’
            sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on
            low speed for 30 seconds,<br> then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. 
            Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting
            is<br> too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is  too thick. (I usually add
             1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble and frost:</strong> If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to 
            slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is<br> called “leveling” 
            the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake 
            stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top<br> with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and 
            spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula 
            and bench scraper for the<br> frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the
            shape. After that, you can serve the cake or continue<br> refrigerating for up to 4–6 
            hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.</li>
    </ol>
